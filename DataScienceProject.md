# up206a-wendy: Data Science Project Notes
### Introduction
For my data science project, I am interested in the intersection of the built environment and environmental health. I would like to see how healthy communities are based on exposure to pollutants and access to places (e.g., parks) and see if this differs by race/ethnicity and location. 
For data I plan to use the following: 
* CalEnvironScreen 3.0
* SCAG Healthy Places Index 
* California Healthy Places Index
