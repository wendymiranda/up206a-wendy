**Cushing et al. (2015). Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Cumulative Environmental Health Impacts in California: Evidence From a Statewide Environmental Justice Screening Tool (CalEnvironScreen 1.1). *American Journal of Public Health, 105*(11), 2341-2348. doi: (10.2105/AJPH.2015.302643)**

In Cushing et al. (2015), the purpose of the article was to determine inequitable distributions of environmental factors (e.g., pesticide use, pollutants) among vulnerable communities. For this study, the indicators from the CalEnviroScreen 1.1 tool were used to create a cumulative impact score, a score that determines how much a community is impacted by environmental, socioeconomic, and health factors (e.g., asthma, poverty). This score ranges from 0 to 100 with 100 being the most impacted. Cumulative impact scores were compared by location, location type (urban vs rural), and demographics. Cushing et al. (2015) found that the San Joaquin Valley and the Southern California area were the most affected areas. Latinx and Black folks had greater cumulative impact scores, mainly due to their pollution burden. It was shown that the odds of living in the one of the 10% most affected Latinx folks is 6.5, for Black folks is 5.75, for Native Americans is 1.94, for Asian/Pacific Islanders is 1.83, and for multiracial folks is 1.63. These results suggest that communities of color are more impacted by environmental hazards compared to white communities.
