# Week 4 Individual Assignment: Mapathon

For mapathon, I participated in 2 events: the introduction to qGIS workshop and Ben Welsh's closing keynote. I really did enjoy learning more about how to create 
a map on qGIS (image below). While I did get lost during the workshop, I still found the software fascinating and do plan to review the recording to complete the map. I do admit, based on this workshop and lecture, I do prefer python over qGIS because it seems as though you can do a lot more with python. As for Ben Welsh's closing keynote, it was interesting learning more about how different stories get published based on if it was an anticipating/planned event vs an unexpected event. He gave the example of Kobe's death as an unexpected event and it was interesting seeing how he incorporated maps into this particular story. Throughout the time that he was showing examples, such as the LA police killings and mask wearing in California, I thoughout about how maps can be used to create stories that can inform policy changes across multiple disciplines. Overall, mapathon was a great and fun event to attend and I look forward to attending the UC-wide GIS week.
