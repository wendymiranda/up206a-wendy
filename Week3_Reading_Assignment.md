#Week 3 Assignment 

This is my first time ever learning about GIS or just spatial data science over all, so reading these two articles a bit challenging, but overall it was great to 
learn about. I find that OSMNx can be a very useful tool for street design and also to just look even closely at certain areas rather than just a census tract, 
county, etc. This can also be very interesting for other disciplines such as public health. In particular, to tract the spread of diseases, such as COIVD-19. As 
far as my own research, in particular with the group project, it may be interesting to use OSMnx to determine which neighborhoods in particular have greater 
to green spaces. Additionally, it would be interesting to see which neighborhoods or streets have greater accessibility to green spaces, whether it is of walking
distance or not.
