# Week 7 Individual Assignment 
For this assignment, I read the parking paper. I thought it was a very interesting approach to use GPS data to track cruising. I also think this approach 
makes a lot more sense and can be more accurate compared to other methodologies such as shadowing vehicles by bike which can be biased and very time consuming. 
I'd be curious to see how this methodology compares to other methodologies in terms of accuract and precision. It is very exciting seeing how more and more 
research, not just in transporation, but also different fields, are starting to incorporate GPS data into their research.


Questions
* In the paper it was mentioned that some of trips were more of valet parking, etc., how do you determine when some of these trips are not cruising (such as the 
valet parking)? Is it difficult to determine this?
* What are you next steps? Do you plan to replicate this study to see if this methodology is a good approach?
